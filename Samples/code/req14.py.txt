REQ014: The vehicle software should support voice commands for hands-free operation". Here's a simple Python code example using the SpeechRecognition library:

import speech_recognition as sr  
  
def listen_for_command():  
    # Create a recognizer instance  
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()  
  
    # Use the default microphone as the audio source  
    with sr.Microphone() as source:  
        print("Listening for command...")  
          
        # Reduce background noise  
        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)  
          
        # Listen for the first phrase and extract it into audio data  
        audio_data = recognizer.listen(source)  
  
    try:  
        # Recognize speech using Google Speech Recognition  
        print("Recognizing command...")  
        command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)  
        print(f"Command received: {command}")  
          
        # Here, you would implement functionality to handle the command  
        # For example, if the command is "navigate home", the software would start navigation towards the user's home  
        # If the command is "play music", the software would start playing music, and so on  
  
    except sr.UnknownValueError:  
        # Google Speech Recognition could not understand audio  
        print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand the audio")  
    except sr.RequestError as e:  
        # Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service  
        print(f"Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {e}")  
  
listen_for_command()
